# CSC 438 â€“ App Development

This repository is for my **CSC 438: App Development** class.
It will include all classwork, assignments, and the final project for the course.

The projects in this repo are built using **Android Studio**.

Feel free to explore the code as it develops throughout the semester. Stay tuned for the final project, and be sure to star this repo to follow along.

Sensitive informations will not be on this repo - we might use envelope encryption (KMS) - EMS.
